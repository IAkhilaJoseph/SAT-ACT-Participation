### Problem Statement

How to increase SAT's participation among high school students and what strategies can the College Board employ to achieve this. 

### Executive Summary

The project examines aggregate SAT and ACT scores and participation rates from each state in the United States. The data given is organized as state level for years 2017 and 2018. ACT component/section level scores are not available for 2018. This allows for comparison of state by state participation rates and scores for each test. 

We observe that a **state with high participation in one test tends toward lower participation in the other**. This may be because many of the states mandate one of the exams as requirement for college entrance and thus the students take only one of these tests. Largely, states show similar participation rates year on year for SAT exams. **There are 17-18 states consistently scoring  <10% for participation rate in both years**. It is noteworthy though, that out of these 18 states, **Illinois showed significant increase in participation rate in 2018 vs. 2017 - a raise from 9% participation in 2017 to 99%**. Another similar case is Colorado from 11% in 2017 to 100% in 2018. We understand the **change in state policy mandating students in these states to take SATs instead of ACTs**, and that explains the shift in participation rates. This suggests that state policies for test taking requirements may be playing a significant role in the participation numbers.

We also observe the **strong negative correlation between participation rates and average test scores**. i.e States with low participation rates for a given test scores higher average than a state with high participation rates on that same test. This may be due to **selection bias**. This means that students choosing to take SATs (in addition to ACT) in an ACT dominated/ mandated states tend to be high scorers. Similar correlation is noted in ACT participation rate to its average composite score. Therefore **higher mean scores are not necessarily representative of a better education system**. 

### Conclusions and Recommendations

The ACT and SAT participation distributions mirrors each other, with **states preferring one test or the other** based on the mandate in the state. ACT shows a **large group of high scoring states**, and **a higher base participation nationwide** with only 5 state scoring <25% participation rate. ACT has a **large cluster of states at 100% participation**. SAT, however shows a **larger group of states with <10% particpation** and then a cluster of states with 50%-75% participation rates, as well as a smaller set of high scoring states. This speaks of the success of ACT.

**ACT and SAT scores have strong negative correlation with their respective participation rates**. This is likely due to selection bias, as low participation means those who are participating appears to be high scorers, and high participation means weaker quality of performance.

The SAT made clear gains in 2018 relative to the ACT. The states contributing to these gains come from **8%-15% participation range in 2017, or around the 70% range**, in the distribution of SAT participation rate by state. **Targeting states with lower participation rate for SATs in 2018 where ACT is currently not mandated** would be promising opportunity for the College Board to invest in the near future.
